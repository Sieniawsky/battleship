Battleship
==========

Design and analysis project for CSI4105.

`Runner.class` contains the main method for the project. Two runtime arguments are required. The first is the name of the dataset that you wish to use and the second is an integer. Use 0 for brute-force, 1 for backtracking, and 2 for genetic. For example: `dataset-100.txt 2` will use the genetic algorithm and the named dataset.
